# Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

## Overview
Hello, my name is Koushik Kundu. I am pleased to share that I was selected for the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham, a collaborative CSR initiative by Microsoft and SAP that focuses on AI technologies. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project: the Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture. I hope you find it valuable.

## Features
- Upload plant images for disease prediction.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained Keras model.

## Technologies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework.
- **TensorFlow**: For model predictions.
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data manipulation and visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koushikkundu/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant_disease_detection
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
Access it at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Model
The model is saved as `plant_disease_detection_model.keras` and predicts various plant diseases.

## Class Labels
The model can identify multiple plant diseases, including:
- Apple Scab
- Black Rot
- Cedar Apple Rust
- Healthy (and more...)

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
